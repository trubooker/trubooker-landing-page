          incomplete;
        </li>
        <li>
          ask that we delete personal data that we hold about you (the “right to
          be forgotten”);
        </li>
        <li>
          withdraw consent at any time for the future to our processing of your

      <p className="mb-4">
        In addition, in certain circumstances, we may process your personal data

        communication and products to your perceived needs. In the case we
        process your Personal Information through automated decision-making, we
        will inform you about the logic involved, as well as the significance
        and the envisaged consequences of such processing for you. Depending on
        your location, you may be able to request not to be subject to automated
        decision-making, including profiling.

        12. How Long We Retain Your Personal Information
      </h1>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We will only retain your Personal Information as long as reasonably
        required for the purposes as set out in this Privacy Policy or otherwise
        to comply with legal or regulatory requirements applicable to us.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we
        consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the
        potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your
        personal data, and the applicable legal requirements.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        You can request to have all your personal information deleted entirely.
        Please note that if you request the erasure of your personal
        information, we may retain and use your personal information to the
        extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, including but not
        limited to tax, legal reporting, and auditing obligations.

          you.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold my-6 uppercase">13. Children</h1>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Our Platforms are not directed towards children and we request that
        children below the age of 18 do not provide Personal Information through
        our Platforms.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 18 who has
        registered on our Platforms, or who you believe has otherwise provided
        Personal Information to us, please contact us using the details set out
        at “how to contact us” below to have the information deleted.
        Information voluntarily provided by children via e-mails, message
        boards, chat sessions, etc. may be used by other parties to generate
        unsolicited e-mails. We encourage parents and legal guardians to inform
        children about how to use the Internet safely and responsibly.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">

        14. Transfers to Other Countries
      </h1>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Your Personal Information may be transferred to and processed in other
        countries where laws governing the processing of Personal Information
        may be less stringent than the laws in Nigeria.

      <p className="mb-4">
        In such cases, where required by law we will ensure that there are
        adequate safeguards in place to protect your Personal Information.
        Depending on the location of the entity exporting the relevant Personal
        Information, this adequate safeguard might be a data transfer agreement
        with the recipient based on standard contractual clauses. Where we are
        legally required to do so, further details of these transfers and copies
        of these agreements are available from us on request.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        To the extent required and valid under law, you consent to your Personal
        Information being transferred and processed this way.
